Open-Raleigh-Policy
===================
## Problem this Solves

Technology moves much faster than policy ever could. Often when writing policy for technology, departments and municipalities are stuck with outdated methods as soon as they publish new policies.

## How this Project Solves this Problem

This framework is meant to be a living document so that collaboration in the open data ecosystem is fostered and the continual update of technology pieces that affect updates can happen at a more rapid pace.
